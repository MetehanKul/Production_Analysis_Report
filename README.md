# Production Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing production data using Python and Power BI. The aim is to extract valuable insights into production efficiency, scrap rates, and profitability through visualizations and data analysis techniques.

## Project Overview

To achieve these objectives, the project uses both Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and Power BI for interactive reporting. The dataset contains production metrics, such as production quantities, scrap amounts, and delivered units. The notebook handles data cleaning, preprocessing, and statistical analysis, while the Power BI dashboard provides an interactive view of key performance indicators.

## The project involved the following steps:

1. **Data collection and preprocessing**  
   Imported raw production data from Excel and cleaned the dataset to remove inconsistencies.

2. **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)**  
   Analyzed trends in production quantities, scrap rates, and delivery efficiencies to gain initial insights.

3. **Visualization of key metrics**  
   Visualized production trends, scrap rates, and delivery performance through Python's Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries, as well as Power BI dashboards.

4. **Power BI Dashboard Creation**  
   Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) related to production, scrap, and profitability.

## Results

The analysis provided insights into production performance and scrap trends over time. Key bottlenecks were identified, and the interactive Power BI dashboard allows users to explore the data further by filtering by operator, product, and date range. The project offers a comprehensive view of production efficiency, helping decision-makers optimize processes.

## Key Features

- Interactive Power BI dashboard for real-time insights
- Python-driven data analysis and visualization
- Detailed production performance reports

## Files in the Project

- `production.ipynb`: Python notebook with all data analysis and visualizations.
- `Üretim.xlsx`: Excel file with the raw production data.
- `Üretim_raporu.pbix`: Power BI dashboard file containing interactive visualizations.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a complete toolkit for analyzing production data, with a strong focus on efficiency and profitability. Through both Python and Power BI, it provides actionable insights for improving production performance.
